<p>
SHANGHAI — Chinese cosmetic surgeons are enjoying a boom in business as desperate graduates seek to boost their chances in the ultra-competitive job market by enhancing their looks.
<br><br>
About 7 million students will graduate from Chinese universities this month. But with the country’s economic growth rate slipping and companies hiring fewer staff, new openings are few and far between.
<br><br>
“There is a mismatch between what graduates expect and what the country can offer,” said the economics professor Shujie Yao, the head of the University of Nottingham’s school of contemporary Chinese studies. “There is a twisted labour market and there is no quick fix.”
<br><br>
But it seems Chinese job hunters think there is one fix. Cosmetic surgery clinics in Shanghai say anxious students are now beating a path to their operating tables in the belief that improving their appearance will lift their job prospects.
<br><br>
Liu Qi, a representative of one of the city’s top plastic surgery hospitals, said about 20% of its 1,600 patients each month are students, up from the usual 7%.

	</div>
<p>	
“Although we often say that you shouldn’t judge a person by the way they look, good looks can really give you an advantage,” said Ms Liu, from the Shanghai Time Plastic Surgery Hospital, which charges pounds 2,015 for a nose reshaping and pounds 1,060 for eyelid surgery.
<br><br>
Wang Xiao-Min, an associate chief surgeon at the hospital, said physical appearance had become increasingly important since the foundations for China’s economic boom were laid in the late 1970s.
<br><br>
“If Deng Xiaoping was living in these times he wouldn’t have made it that far,” said Dr Wang. “He would probably have been rejected at most job interviews.”
<br><br>
“Of course ability is one thing but appearance also really matters. Appearance is the first impression you give,” added Dr Wang, who estimates that 30% to 40% of students are consulting plastic surgeons. “Mostly it is about meeting their psychological needs to make them feel more confident.”

		<div class="underline"></div>

<p>
One 20-year-old administration graduate who recently had rhinoplasty was clear about why she had done it.

<br><br>
“Surely it will help with job hunting and face-to-face interviews,” said the woman, who declined to be named. “Based on my own personal experience, it is true that it is easier for pretty girls to find and secure jobs.” As millions of students prepare to enter the contracting job market, alarm bells are ringing in Beijing, where graduate unemployment is viewed as a potential trigger for “instability”.
</p>

<p>
In May, on the eve of the end of China’s academic year, president Xi Jinping popped up at a graduate job fair in Tianjin in an apparent attempt to reassure young jobseekers.
<br><br>
“Employment is the basis of people’s livelihood, and is also an issue confronting the whole world,” he told students according to state news agency Xinhua. “Without economic growth, the employment issue can’t be solved.”
<br><br>
In April, China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, admitted the country’s economic outlook was “complicated” after first-quarter economic growth fell from 7.9% to 7.7%. In the same month, the Chinese media reported that less than a third of graduates in Beijing and Shanghai had signed job contracts.
<br><br>
Prof. Yao said that while a decade of rapid expansion in China’s higher education sector was undoubtedly positive it had led to an “over-supply of graduates” with unrealistic expectations. Absorbing the sudden deluge of graduates into well-paid jobs was a virtually impossible task, he added.
<br><br>
“In a normal year – when the economy is booming – it is still fairly difficult to accommodate all of the graduates. The situation can get worse if the economy slows down. That makes the market even more difficult for graduates,” said Prof. Yao. “This country is not going to create 7m white-collar jobs a year – it is impossible.”
<br><br>
Chinese leaders now need to offer support to small and medium-sized enterprises and to focus on “the quality rather than the quantity of education”.
<br><br>
“The economy is not going to go back to double-digit [growth] levels, 7% to 8% growth is quite lucky given the world financial crisis,” added Prof. Yao.
<br><br>
The Shanghai Time Plastic Surgery Hospital is offering discounts to cash-strapped graduates. “We are not looking to make money from the students,” said a hospital representative. “We just want to make [surgery] more accessible to those in need.”
