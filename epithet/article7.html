<p>Should your boss have a say over how your wear your hair?<br><br>

Lara Odoffin, a Bournemouth University graduate, shared a post on Facebook this week in which she claimed an employer had withdrawn a job offer because she wears her hair in braids.<br><br>

In the note she shared on Facebook, the unnamed company said: “Unfortunately we cannot accept braids - it is simply part of the uniform and grooming requirements we get from our clients. If you are unable to take them out I unfortunately won’t be able to offer you any work.”
</p>


	<div class="center-title">
		<div class="underline"></div>
		<h1>"I'VE HEARD A THICK ACCENT AND THOUGHT, 'BOY, HE HASN'T LEFT THE NEIGHBRHOOD.'" </h1>
		<div class="underline"></div>
	</div>

<p>
In her post, which has been shared close to 3000 times, Lara writes: “This type of discrimination should not still be happening in this day and age and any establishment still condoning such practices deserve to be shamed and criticised.”<br><br>
“Being a black woman means that to have a long term hairstyle that stays neat is always going to be a problem. Having braids that last for 2-4 months and can be packed neatly and styled to however a workplace requires is the solution to this problem.”<br><br>
“No workplace has any right to forbid you from this. This is discrimination and I am disgusted that I had to be subject to such behaviour in this 21st century.”
<br><br>
Lara's case echoes that of Simone Powderly, another young black woman who made headlines earlier this year after a recuiter asked her to remove her braids or else miss out on a potential opportunity with a modelling agency. Simone told The Voice: "I couldn’t decide what to do; if I took them out then I wasn’t standing up for equal rights and basically saying it’s OK to discriminate against me."
</p>

		<h1>“AN ACCENT SHOULDN'T MATTER, BUT IT DOES"</h1>
		<div class="underline"></div>
	</div>


<p>In a further Facebook post, Lara thanked those who’d been sharing her story, and added:<br><br>

“I am not currently naming the company (as much as i'd like to right now out of indignation and anger) because I do not intend to destroy someones livelihood and business, and I don't really want a lawsuit on my hands either.”
<br><br>
“However it does not deter from the fact now that I have chanced upon an opportunity to correct blatant ignorance and discrimination, and it is a fact that I certainly will keep going until it is put to rest. If it does result in me having no choice but to completely expose the company, I have no problem in doing so.”
<br><br>
“This policy needs to be eradicated completely, there is no room for such rules in this day and age- across any sector. More than anything it just made me upset. I had the right experience, they were happy to have me. It was just about my hair.”
