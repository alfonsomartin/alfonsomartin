    <h2>Poke Holes</h2>

Technically your done but if you want to make your mask wearable you need to make holes using the sewing awl on the sides of the mask. Be careful with it. After you have made your holes you can tie a rubber band through the holes ot whatever you choose as a string to allow the mask to stay on your face. For mine I used a rubberband.
