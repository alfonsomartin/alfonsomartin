      <p>Presently she began again. &lsquo;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it&rsquo;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--&rsquo; (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn&rsquo;t sound at all the right word) &lsquo;--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&rsquo;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&rsquo; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you&rsquo;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &lsquo;And what an ignorant little girl she&rsquo;ll think me for asking! No, it&rsquo;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&rsquo; (Dinah was the cat.) &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&rsquo; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &lsquo;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&rsquo; and sometimes, &lsquo;Do bats eat cats?&rsquo; for, you see, as she couldn&rsquo;t answer either question, it didn&rsquo;t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &lsquo;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&rsquo; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>
      <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&rsquo;s getting!&rsquo; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>
      <div class="quote-1">&ldquo;Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin..&rdquo;</div>
      <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&rsquo;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>
      <p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; &lsquo;and even if my head would go through,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.&rsquo; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p>
      <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (&lsquo;which certainly was not here before,&rsquo; said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &lsquo;DRINK ME&rsquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
