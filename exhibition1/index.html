<h1 class="shake">Interpreting the Sounds of the Cocteau Twins</h1>

<p class="shake2">The music from Cocteau Twins album Heaven or Las Vegas is beautifully</p>
<p class="shake">indefinable and successful in its approach to music making. Thanks to</p>
<p class="shake2">Frasers operatic vocals partnered with her band members, Robin Guthrie</p> 
<p class="shake">and Simon Raymond sonic melodies, the Cocteau Twins had created</p> a new unique sound that has influenced many. In interviews, Elizabeth Fraser defines her lyric writing process as finding words with no meaning and putting them together and singing them to give them meaning. Fraser also is a very emotional singer and performer, and lets out her emotions in her lyrics and in her singing performance. This album also has this euphoric essence and obscureness because as a listener you can only make out a few words and it is also the bands most popular album to date. This exhibition explores each of the songs from the Cocteau Twins Heaven or Las Vegas in a visual context and analyzes how we perceive words and phonetic sounds visually and emotionally.</p>
