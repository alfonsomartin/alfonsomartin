   <p>Yuki is very energetic. He has so much energy sometimes that he practically bounces off the walls! He is very affectionate to people he is familiar with but can be very anxious around strangers. He also hates being left alone. In addition, do not put your shoe in his face, he will bite your foot because he hates shoes.</p>
