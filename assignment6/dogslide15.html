   <p>Nahla is such a goofball. She is super playful. Sometimes, she is so playful that she wears herself out and she knocks out when she goes to sleep. She is also very smart and obedient. When she does get in trouble she does this thing, where she starts to make whining noises, it is hilarious. </p>
